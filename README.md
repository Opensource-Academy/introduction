# Introduction

## General introduction
For a general introduction to the Opensource Academy, go [here](https://github.com/Opensource-Academy/about).

## Description
General Opensource-Academy introduction on working with this documentation.

### Documentation structure
This documentation is made up out of 'courses' covering a specific subject. Within courses you can find all kinds of information, usualy presented in the form of numbered 'modules', for example, the 'Python' *course* might have a *module* called 'Introduction to Python'.

### Projects, exercises and utilities
The documentation also comes with practise projects, exercises and general information (like a list of offered courses).

### Routes
Routes are a selection of modules put together to guide learners through the available materials.

> Routes' overview pages can be used as study 'indexes'; consider bookmarking your current route's page to make it easy to return there.

## Getting started
If you have not already done so, get started by picking a [study route](https://github.com/Opensource-Academy/routes). Follow the instructions in the corresponding document.

## Keep motivated
Above all, remember: you are doing something awesome that you love and like to do. 

> Especially keep that in mind when something seems a bit too hard or dull.

## At the end of a course
Once you are at the end of a course or part of a course (as described by the study document you chose), go back the the routes's overview to see what's next.
